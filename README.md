# Sys Eden

Local-first Windows system companion, currently implementing Milestone 1 (Core skeleton).

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the versioned canonical documents in [docs](docs/).
The roadmap owns implementation order.

Development requires Python 3.13 and uv:

```powershell
uv sync
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv run eden --help
```

Bootstrap configuration uses validated defaults and `EDEN_` environment overrides,
including `EDEN_DATA_DIRECTORY` and `EDEN_STORAGE__MODELS_BUDGET_GB`.
Storage budgets are independent; automatic rebalancing defaults to disabled.
Budget enforcement belongs to subsequent storage work. Configuration loading does
not create directories. Development runtime data belongs in ignored `data/`.
Do not put credentials in configuration or application log messages.

`uv run eden health` initializes the development SQLite database through packaged
Alembic migrations and returns JSON health for Core, configuration, database, and
the explicitly fake model provider. Failed checks return exit code 1. Health logs
are JSON on stderr. SQLite uses WAL, foreign keys, and a five-second busy timeout.
Existing unknown schema versions are rejected; a verified SQLite backup is retained
before baseline migration. Sessions commit on success and roll back on failure.
The in-process async event bus has bounded delivery and propagates handler failures.
